In this blog post I will be walking you through exploiting a vulnerable Windows driver, demonstrating how attackers leverage legitimate signed drivers to gain kernel-level access and bypass modern security controls like EDR/AV solutions. You'll learn the complete attack chain which will be from driver selection and deployment to exploiting kernel primitives for privilege escalation and defense evasion. I plan to use a forward approach with modern tools to assist in this lab, but I do plan on verifying everything manually to maximize learning. This blog post will contain additional information for each step to communicate thought process and build on our overall understanding of modern security.
