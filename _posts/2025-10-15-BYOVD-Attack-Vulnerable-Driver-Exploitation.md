In this blog post I will be walking you through exploiting a vulnerable Windows driver, demonstrating how attackers leverage legitimate signed drivers to gain kernel-level access and bypass modern security controls like EDR/AV solutions. You'll learn the complete attack chain - from driver selection and deployment to exploiting kernel primitives for privilege escalation and defense evasion. This technique, known as BYOVD (Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver), has been used in real-world ransomware campaigns and APT operations, making it essential knowledge for both red teamers and security defenders.
