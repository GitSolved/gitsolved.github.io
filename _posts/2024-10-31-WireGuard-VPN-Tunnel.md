# WireGuard: VPN Tunnel - Server & Client Configuration

Online privacy and security offer many benefits. VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) have become essential tools for protecting personal data and ensuring secure internet connections. WireGuard has gained acceptance among many security and IT professionals due to its simplicity and robust security features.

## What is WireGuard?

WireGuard is a modern VPN protocol that runs inside the Linux kernel. It's designed to be faster, simpler, and more secure than traditional VPN protocols like OpenVPN or IPSec.

### Key Features

- **Lightweight**: Only 4,000 lines of C code (compared to hundreds of thousands in other VPN implementations)
- **Strong Encryption**: 256-bit encryption using ChaCha20 cipher with Poly1305 message authentication code
- **High Performance**: Reduced CPU usage and faster connection times
- **Cross-Platform**: Supports Linux, Windows, MacOS, Android, iOS, and Raspberry Pi
- **Kernel Integration**: Runs inside the Linux kernel for optimal performance

### Benefits

- **Security**: Fewer lines of code mean fewer bugs and security vulnerabilities
- **Speed**: Significantly faster than traditional VPN protocols
- **Simplicity**: Easier to configure and maintain than alternatives
- **Efficiency**: Lower CPU and battery usage

### Limitations

- **Static IP addresses**: WireGuard requires static IP configuration
- **IP persistence**: IP addresses remain in memory after disconnection
- **DPI vulnerability**: Vulnerable to Deep Packet Inspection tracking
- **No obfuscation**: Lacks built-in traffic obfuscation features
- **UDP only**: Does not support TCP protocol
- **IP exposure**: Traffic uses the server's public IP address

## Setup Guide

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- A Linux server with root/sudo access
- A static public IP address or dynamic DNS
- Port forwarding capability on your router

### Step 1: Expose WireGuard Server to the Internet

First, you need to ensure your server can receive external connections:

1. **Configure a static IP** from your ISP or set up dynamic DNS
2. **Set up port forwarding** on your router to forward UDP port 51820 (or your chosen port) to your WireGuard server

### Step 2: Network Analysis

Install network tools and verify connectivity:

```bash
# Install netcat for testing
sudo apt install netcat -y

# Check network interfaces
ifconfig -a

# Monitor UDP traffic (in one terminal)
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 "udp port 51820"

# Test UDP connectivity (from another machine)
netcat -v -z -u YOUR_SERVER_IP 51820
```

### Step 3: Install WireGuard

```bash
# Update package list
sudo apt update

# Install WireGuard and required tools
sudo apt install wireguard wireguard-tools iptables -y
```

### Step 4: Enable IP Forwarding

Enable packet forwarding to allow VPN traffic routing:

```bash
# Edit sysctl configuration
sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf

# Uncomment this line:
# net.ipv4.ip_forward=1

# Apply changes
sudo sysctl -p

# Verify forwarding is enabled (should return 1)
cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
```

### Step 5: Generate Server Keys

Create cryptographic keys for the server:

```bash
# Navigate to WireGuard directory
cd /etc/wireguard

# Generate private and public keys
wg genkey | tee server-privatekey | wg pubkey > server-publickey

# Secure the private key
chmod 600 server-privatekey

# View the keys (save these for configuration)
cat server-privatekey
cat server-publickey
```

### Step 6: Create Server Configuration

Create the WireGuard server configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf
```

Add the following configuration:

```ini
[Interface]
Address = 10.0.0.1/24
ListenPort = 51820
PrivateKey = YOUR_SERVER_PRIVATE_KEY

# Packet forwarding
PostUp = iptables -A FORWARD -i wg0 -j ACCEPT
PostUp = iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
PostDown = iptables -D FORWARD -i wg0 -j ACCEPT
PostDown = iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE

# Client configurations will be added below
# [Peer]
# PublicKey = CLIENT_PUBLIC_KEY
# AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.2/32
```

**Important**: Replace `YOUR_SERVER_PRIVATE_KEY` with the content from `server-privatekey` and adjust `eth0` to match your network interface.

Secure the configuration file:

```bash
sudo chmod 600 /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf
```

### Step 7: Start WireGuard Service

Enable and start the WireGuard service:

```bash
# Start WireGuard
sudo systemctl start wg-quick@wg0

# Enable on boot
sudo systemctl enable wg-quick@wg0

# Check status
sudo systemctl status wg-quick@wg0

# View active connections
sudo wg show
```

## Client Configuration

### Step 1: Install WireGuard Client

Download and install WireGuard for your platform:
- **Windows/Mac/Linux**: [wireguard.com/install](https://www.wireguard.com/install/)
- **Android**: Google Play Store
- **iOS**: Apple App Store

### Step 2: Generate Client Keys

On the client machine (or server):

```bash
# Generate client keys
wg genkey | tee client-privatekey | wg pubkey > client-publickey

# View keys
cat client-privatekey
cat client-publickey
```

### Step 3: Create Client Configuration

Create a client configuration file (`client.conf`):

```ini
[Interface]
PrivateKey = CLIENT_PRIVATE_KEY
Address = 10.0.0.2/32
DNS = 1.1.1.1, 8.8.8.8

[Peer]
PublicKey = SERVER_PUBLIC_KEY
Endpoint = YOUR_SERVER_PUBLIC_IP:51820
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0
PersistentKeepalive = 25
```

**Configuration details**:
- `CLIENT_PRIVATE_KEY`: The client's private key
- `SERVER_PUBLIC_KEY`: The server's public key
- `YOUR_SERVER_PUBLIC_IP`: Your server's public IP or domain
- `AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0`: Routes all traffic through VPN (use `10.0.0.0/24` for split tunneling)

### Step 4: Add Client to Server

Update the server configuration to allow the client:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf
```

Add a peer section:

```ini
[Peer]
PublicKey = CLIENT_PUBLIC_KEY
AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.2/32
```

Restart WireGuard to apply changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart wg-quick@wg0
```

### Step 5: Connect Client

**On Linux**:
```bash
sudo wg-quick up client
```

**On Windows/Mac**:
1. Open WireGuard application
2. Import the `client.conf` file
3. Click "Activate"

**On Mobile**:
1. Open WireGuard app
2. Scan QR code or import configuration
3. Toggle connection on

## Testing the Connection

### Verify VPN Connection

```bash
# Check connection status
sudo wg show

# Test connectivity through VPN
ping 10.0.0.1

# Verify your public IP (should show server's IP)
curl ifconfig.me
```

### Monitor Traffic

On the server:

```bash
# Watch real-time connections
watch -n 1 sudo wg show

# Monitor bandwidth
sudo iftop -i wg0
```

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

1. **Check firewall rules**:
```bash
sudo ufw allow 51820/udp
sudo ufw status
```

2. **Verify routing**:
```bash
ip route show table all | grep wg0
```

3. **Check logs**:
```bash
sudo journalctl -u wg-quick@wg0 -f
```

### Common Problems

- **Can't connect**: Verify port forwarding and firewall rules
- **No internet**: Check IP forwarding and iptables rules
- **Slow speeds**: Verify MTU settings (try `MTU = 1420` in config)
- **Connection drops**: Add `PersistentKeepalive = 25` to client config

## Security Best Practices

1. **Use strong keys**: Never share or reuse private keys
2. **Limit peer IPs**: Only allow necessary IP ranges in `AllowedIPs`
3. **Regular updates**: Keep WireGuard updated on all systems
4. **Monitor logs**: Regularly check for suspicious connection attempts
5. **Firewall rules**: Use restrictive firewall rules alongside WireGuard
6. **Key rotation**: Periodically rotate keys for enhanced security

## Expected Outcomes

After successful setup, you'll achieve:

- **Secure remote access** to your home/office network
- **Enhanced privacy** when using public WiFi
- **Encrypted internet** traffic
- **Fast VPN connections** with minimal overhead
- **Access to geo-restricted** content
- **Protection** from ISP tracking

## Conclusion

WireGuard represents a modern approach to VPN technology, offering simplicity without sacrificing security. Its lightweight design and strong cryptography make it an excellent choice for both personal and enterprise use. Whether you're securing remote access or protecting your internet privacy, WireGuard provides a robust and efficient solution.
