## Hi, I'm Samir Anastasio

I'm a security researcher specializing in **AI Security** and **Binary Exploitation**, with a focus on discovering and understanding vulnerabilities in modern systems. Through GitSolved, I share technical writeups, research, and educational content to help others learn offensive security techniques.

### What I Do

**AI Security Research**
- OWASP LLM vulnerability analysis and exploitation
- Prompt injection techniques and bypass methodologies
- Large Language Model security testing (Lakera AI CTF, Gandalf challenges)
- AI/ML security implications and defense strategies

**Binary Exploitation**
- Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) chain development
- Stack-based buffer overflow exploitation
- ret2libc techniques and ASLR bypass methods
- CTF challenge solutions and walkthroughs

**Security Operations**
- SOC automation with Wazuh SIEM, TheHive, and Shuffle SOAR
- Security monitoring and incident response workflows
- Threat detection and automated analysis pipelines

### Featured Content

This site features detailed technical writeups covering:
- **CTF Challenges**: OverTheWire Bandit, Lakera AI Security, and more
- **Binary Exploitation**: ROP chains, buffer overflows, memory corruption
- **AI Security**: LLM prompt injection, model vulnerabilities
- **Security Automation**: SOC lab builds, SIEM/SOAR integration
- **Network Security**: VPN configuration, secure networking

### Focus Areas

- ü§ñ **AI/LLM Security**: Exploring vulnerabilities in Large Language Models
- üîì **Binary Exploitation**: Low-level exploitation techniques
- üö© **Capture The Flag**: Educational CTF writeups and solutions
- üõ°Ô∏è **Blue Team Operations**: Security monitoring and automation

### Philosophy

I believe in **learning by doing**. All content here emphasizes hands-on technical skills with step-by-step explanations. Whether you're analyzing memory layouts for ROP chains or crafting prompt injection attacks, my goal is to make complex security concepts accessible through practical examples.

### Connect

I'm always interested in collaborating on security research and discussing new techniques.
